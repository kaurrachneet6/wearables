%BUTTER Butterworth digital and analog filter design.
%   [B,A] = BUTTER(N,Wn) designs an Nth order lowpass digital
%   Butterworth filter and returns the filter coefficients in length 
%   N+1 vectors B (numerator) and A (denominator). The coefficients 
%   are listed in descending powers of z. The cutoff frequency 
%   Wn must be 0.0 < Wn < 1.0, with 1.0 corresponding to 
%   half the sample rate.
%
%   If Wn is a two-element vector, Wn = [W1 W2], BUTTER returns an 
%   order 2N bandpass filter with passband  W1 < W < W2.
%   [B,A] = BUTTER(N,Wn,'high') designs a highpass filter.
%   [B,A] = BUTTER(N,Wn,'low') designs a lowpass filter.
%   [B,A] = BUTTER(N,Wn,'stop') is a bandstop filter if Wn = [W1 W2].
%   
%   When used with three left-hand arguments, as in
%   [Z,P,K] = BUTTER(...), the zeros and poles are returned in
%   length N column vectors Z and P, and the gain in scalar K. 
%
%   When used with four left-hand arguments, as in
%   [A,B,C,D] = BUTTER(...), state-space matrices are returned.
%
%   BUTTER(N,Wn,'s'), BUTTER(N,Wn,'high','s') and BUTTER(N,Wn,'stop','s')
%   design analog Butterworth filters.  In this case, Wn is in [rad/s]
%   and it can be greater than 1.0.
